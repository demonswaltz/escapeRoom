So, you left your research papers here in the library and you want me to let you in to get them, right? Well, I run a tight ship here and once we’re closed we’re closed. Anything that gets left behind… becomes mine. Some shoddy looking homework was left behind today.  That’s right, I have your precious papers locked safe and sound in my office and I’ll be happy to give them tomorrow, right after we open at 9 am.  OMG, it looks like it’s due tomorrow morning.  Maybe you shouldn’t have been so distracted playing on your phones and on the computer, that silly MindCraft game and Chatsnapping with your friends. Well, it looks like you’ll have some explaining to do tomorrow of why you’re homeworks late.  And by the way, don’t be trying any funny business you know we have this placed covered by security cameras.  AND I have some workmen coming over in exactly 40 minutes and I don’t want you pestering them and getting in their way.

Have a good night :-)

STATIC!!

1:  Once you’re in  look all over the library, search drawers and everything to try and find codes, clues and passwords.  Oh!  Just a note, nothing on the walls should have to come off, please don’t touch any of the pictures on the wall, if they are out of place even just the slightest, the library director will know you were there.  Leave the places looking as if nothing was messed with!
